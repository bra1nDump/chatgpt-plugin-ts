# How to run the project
## local
- Run `npm install`
- To run the server, run `npm run dev`
- Navigate to https://chat.openai.com.
- In the Model drop down, select "Plugins" (note, if you don't see it there, you don't have access yet).
- Select "Plugin store"
- Select "Develop your own plugin"
- Enter in localhost:8787 since this is the URL the server is running on locally, then select "Find manifest file".
- The plugin should now be installed and enabled! You can start with a question like "Show me how VSCode architecture looks like"
## Docker
- run `docker-compose up -d`

> Note: There is some unused code in the repo which we didn't have time to clean up. Its mostly related to running GPT-4 on the server side and multi diagram support.
